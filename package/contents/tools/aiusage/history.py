"""The on-disk half of the shared usage history.

Both frontends keep the rolling series in
``~/.local/share/ai-usage-widget/usage-history-latest.json``. Whoever is running
writes it on every poll, and neither can assume it still holds what it last put
there: the other frontend may have been recording in the meantime, and a second
Plasma widget instance is a writer too. So a save is a union against what is
already on disk, not an overwrite.

The union cannot tell which of two values for a key is the newer reading, so it
gives the payload precedence — safe only because a payload is the caller's own
new readings. A caller offering a series it merely restored passes
``--keep-existing``, and the file keeps its own values instead.

The rules here mirror ``package/contents/code/UsageHistory.js`` — the frontends
apply the same union in QML when they restore at startup. ``tests/shared-code.test.js``
replays a shared fixture through both implementations and compares the JSON byte
for byte, so the two cannot drift apart unnoticed.
