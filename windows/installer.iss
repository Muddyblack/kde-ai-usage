; Windows installer for the AI Usage tray app (Inno Setup 6).
;
; Built by windows/build-installer.ps1 from PyInstaller's "dist\AI Usage" folder
; (windows/ai-usage.spec), in .github/workflows/windows.yml — on every push, and
; for each release, which release.yml runs that workflow for.
;
; Per user: no admin rights, installed to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\AI Usage.
; Settings and history live in %APPDATA% / %LOCALAPPDATA%\ai-usage-widget and
; survive updates and uninstalls alike.
