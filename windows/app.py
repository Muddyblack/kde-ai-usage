"""AI Usage for Windows — a tray icon with the same popup as the Hyprland panel.

The popup is the shared QML under hyprland/ (PopupContent.qml, SettingsPage.qml
and the components they use); qml/Main.qml wraps it in a frameless window and
implements the `shell` interface they read. The data comes from the same
aiusage package every other frontend runs, called in-process: there is no
shell on Windows to run tools/sh/* through, and nothing here needs one.

It runs on Linux too, which is how it is developed: `nix develop .#windows`
brings PySide6 (or `make run-windows`), else `pip install -r windows/requirements.txt`.

  python windows/app.py                  start (a second start toggles the popup)
  python windows/app.py --selftest       load the QML headless, open every settings
                                         section once, exit 1 on any QML warning
  python windows/app.py --screenshot F [--settings]
                                         render the popup (or the settings page)
                                         into F (PNG) and exit
