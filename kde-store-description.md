[h1]AI Usage Monitor[/h1]

I got tired of opening a different website or CLI tool every time I wanted to check how much quota I had left. So I built this: a little panel widget that puts every AI service I use right where I can see it — no tabs, no terminal, just a glance.

[b]One glance at your panel tells you exactly how much you've got left.[/b]

---

[b]What it tracks[/b]

Switch between tabs in the popup for each service:
[list]
[*] [b]Claude[/b] — 5-hour session + 7-day weekly windows
[*] [b]Antigravity / Google AI Studio[/b]
[*] [b]OpenAI API[/b]
[*] [b]Grok / xAI[/b]
[*] [b]Mistral AI[/b]
[*] [b]Kiro[/b]
[*] [b]OpenRouter[/b]
[*] [b]Z.AI[/b] [i](untested)[/i] — 5-hour token quota + monthly tools quota
[*] [b]GitHub Copilot[/b] — monthly premium request usage for personally billed plans
[*] [b]DeepSeek[/b] [i](untested)[/i] — current account balance + granted/topped-up split
[/list]

[b]Why I like using it[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Burn-rate ETA[/b] — tells you [i]"↗ ~3h to 100%"[/i] so you can pace yourself instead of getting surprised
[*] [b]Countdown timers[/b] — ticks down to your next quota reset (refreshes every ~5 min to stay friendly to the APIs)
[*] [b]Usage chart[/b] — a smooth, glowing trend graph with 5H / 24H / 7D toggle and hover-scrub (24H shows the whole day's session burn as a sawtooth)
[*] [b]Period comparison[/b] — [i]"+12% vs last week"[/i] at the same point in the cycle
[*] [b]Theme-aware[/b] — follows your Plasma accent by default, or flip on per-service brand colors
[*] [b]Glassmorphism popup[/b] — translucent, blurred, and honestly just nice to look at
[*] [b]Pin a service[/b] — open straight to your most-used tab
[/list]

[b]Panel modes[/b]

Compact percentage readouts right in the taskbar — color-coded (amber at 70%, red at 90%) with an inline spark-line trend. Pill or compact mode, your call.

[b]Setup[/b]

Reads your credentials from local config files — nothing leaves your machine except the calls to each provider's own usage API. Refresh interval is configurable (1–30 min, default 5).

Credential notes: Z.AI uses the widget setting, [icode]$ZAI_TOKEN[/icode], or [icode]~/.config/zai/token[/icode]. GitHub Copilot uses the widget setting, [icode]$GITHUB_TOKEN[/icode], or [icode]~/.config/github-copilot/token[/icode]; a fine-grained token needs Plan: read permission. The current user endpoint covers personally billed plans, not organization/enterprise-billed usage. DeepSeek uses the widget setting, [icode]$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY[/icode], or [icode]~/.config/deepseek/api-key[/icode].

[b]Requires Plasma 6.0+.[/b]

[i](Yeah, I know yet another AI usage widget, but I wanted one for my own NixOS setup that just worked the way I needed it to. If you're in the same boat, here it is.)[/i] 💙
