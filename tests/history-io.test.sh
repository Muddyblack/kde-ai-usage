# tools/sh/history-io owns the usage-history file that the Plasma widget and the
# Quickshell panel both read and write. The two never coordinate — and a second
# Plasma widget instance is a third writer — so a save has to merge with what is
# already on disk rather than replace it, and a reader must never catch a
# half-written file (the loader here *deletes* anything that does not parse).
#
# The union gives the payload precedence, so what a payload may hold is the whole
# contract. `autosave` carries readings the caller just took, on points only it
# writes, and asserts them. `seed` carries a series the caller restored — its
# config, a snapshot the user imported — which can predate what is on disk, and
# only fills in what the file lacks. Both comparisons happen here, inside the
# lock, because a caller weighing them against its own copy of the file may be
# weighing them against a value the other frontend has already replaced.
# tests/shared-code.test.js drives both frontends through this tool.
